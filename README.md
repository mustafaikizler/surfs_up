## Overview of the analysis

The main purpose of the analysis is to find out if Opening and Operating the Surf Shop will be profitable or not. Throughout the project, we analyzed our raw data (Hawaii. SQLite) by using SQL and Alchemy. Our main tables were the name of the Stations, precipitation numbers, dates, and observed temperature. we retrieved all of the tables and filtered the by date. In a conclusion, we find out if Hawaii's Oahu island is suitable for this investment or not.

In particular, Challenge was about Observed Temperatures during June and December. To achieve this part of the challenge we wrote SQL scripts because our raw data was in the SQLite file.
